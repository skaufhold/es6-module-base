# ES6 Module Base

Boilerplate for an ES6 based module that is bundled with webpack.

`npm run watch` to start webpack in watch mode an automatically recompile on changes

`npm run build` to build the production bundle, which includes a full version and a minified version
of the code.

The build will be done automatically before the module is packaged and published by NPM.
